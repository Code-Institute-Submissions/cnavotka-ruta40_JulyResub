# RUTA 40

This is a project for Milestone 2 for the Code Instiute.

I want to showcase some of my favourite areas of Argentina that lie on Ruta 40 (Route 40). With more than 5,000 kilometers, it is the longest route in Argentina. From the Tropic of Capricorn to almost the Antarctic Circle, it crosses 21 National Parks.
The website would be useful for any person organising a trip.

## Project Resubmission
This is a resubmission, the failed points are:
* LO 1 1.1 Navigation link "Home" is highlighted in all pages.
* LO 1 1.2 Upon form submission, no feedback is shown to the end user.
* LO 3 3.4 Test section can be improved and enhanced significantly in README.
* LO 5 5.1 Design (User Stories), Development (Commits), Testing and deployment documentation all present in ReadMe file, however details are sparse for the sections.


## UX

The website is aimed at users who want to travel or they are interested in finding out more about the area.

* As a user I like to find the information for a selected area easily and fast.
* The information needs to be clear and short, because that would help to decide if I want to investigate more possible place to visit.
* Having the location and one general picture can help me to decide if I am interested in certain spot and is useful for making travel itineraries.

The colour palette mimicks the Road Traffic signals in Argentina (three stripes in blue, white and black).
Based on that, I tried to keep the colour usage and design in a minimalistic way, to avoid distractions for the user. Thinking about the website as the Road signal, something basic but clear to get the information required in a fast way.

Here there is an example:

![Ruta 40 road signal](https://github.com/cnavotka/ruta40/blob/master/assets/images/ruta.png)

The user would be able to find general and specific information about different areas crossed by Ruta 40. The nature of the road means that the users are mostly people looking for adventures and lots of outdoors recreational activities.

Here you can get the wireframes for the different sections and sizes

### Feedback
* As per feedback received in the Assesment (LO1 Design, develop and implement a dinamyc Front End web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 1.1) I fixed the highlighted link "HOME".

Screenshot with the error:

I removed the class "active" of the link Home in the navbar index.html file to fix issue.
Here you can see the the Home link isn't anymore hihlighted in the Contact page:

## Credits

* I used code from ![GitHub](https://github.com/FruitbatM/explore-national-parks-of-japan)) for code in JavaScript file and index.html file.
* CSS tricks for the hover effect in the Gallery
